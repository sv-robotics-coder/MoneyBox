<h1 style="font-size:30px ; color:black "> Introduction

<p style="font-size 20px; color:white"> Finances. Tell any adult that word and they will immediately get a headache. But why? Why do people have such bad visions of dealing with their money? Why do the people have to suffer for the prolific marketing problems of the banks? Maybe, it's just not as accessible. Maybe, people like to head the other way because they're not getting the right insights? Well, MoneyBox is the right place to go to. The current situation is that if you have bank accounts, savings, checkings and credit/debit in various companies you have to log-in to multiple portals and have to switch from window to window. What if, just what if there was a platform to manage all your finances in one place? Check out our amazing site!!!!!!

<h1 style="font-size:30px ; color:black "> A bit about myself

<p style="font-size 20px; color:white"> Hi there! My name is Idhant and I am a Grade 6 student (going to grade 7) student learning at SV Robotics! I am an ethusiatic HTLML/CSS coder and a Python Graduate! I LOVE making websites, even before learning WebDev, I worked with templated, but am extremely happy that now I get full control over my website! I am also an app builder and love to tinker around with anything technology related! You can most often find me curled up on my couch with my favorite book, 'Sapiens'! Most of all, I love being able to use my skills in tech and other subjects for good, and to make people's lives easier! Thanks to SV,I get a chance to build by real-world application skills with the MVP!

<h1 style="font-size:30px ; color:black "> Help & Change

<p style="font-size 20px; color:white"> As previously described the current situation is extremely deteroriating. To check your finances in multiple accounts, and to check your credit card and more, you need at least an hour on hand. Then you would need another 1-1.5 hours to figure out your spending habits, you finally spend approximately another hour setting goals for yourself, and figuring out your recent transactions and making cuts. Why spend extended periods of time managing your finances efficiently? Why not get everything done <i> by your voice commands </i> and get rewarded for doing so? It's a win-win for both! You use our services and we provide you with top of the class, exclusive deals! But most of all, it means much cheaper prices for you and maybe, if MoneyBox gets enough support, an innovative financial institution!


<div align = 'center'>
<h1 style="font-size:30px ; color:black "> How we are different!

<p style="font-size 20px; color:white"> MoneyBox is much different from the other apps that you can find on the internet. Look at other free apps, and you'll see limited functions, and of course, lacking the voice commands and free rewards! We take no commissions out of transfers below $200, and for anything above, the rate is 0.5%! For us, it's a monthly fee, but, if you save up enough rewards, you can even get a few months free! Based on a study done, researchers have concluded, that people are more likely to set financial stability goals, spending limits and pricing cuts if they have some sort of incentive or 'prize' being held before them! We hope that's enough to motivate you to use our app :D
